# Contributing to Anchor
We're currently in the process of developing `v1.0` but there are still issues to iron out with the existing distro: `v0.9.x`. So we've compiled this short document to help you guys help *us*!

### First

1. Find an [issue](https://github.com/anchorcms/anchor-cms/issues) that needs fixing, or create one if you've got a bug, don't worry, simply making us aware of bugs is a big help!

### Getting Anchor set up locally (If you haven't already)

1. Fork anchor (use the button in the top right of the repo's page).
1. `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/anchor-cms` to get a local copy of your fork.
1. Run `git remote add upstream https://github.com/anchor/anchor-cms`. This will add another remote, named upstream, that points to the official Jeet repository. This will help with keeping your forks up to date with Anchor's master branch.

### Making changes

1. `git checkout -b YourInitials/feature-branch-name` (e.g. `cs/improve-this-feature`, `ma/fix-this-bug`). Make all your changes for the specific feature inside this branch.
1. Separate edits into [clean](https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/Writing-good-commit-messages), non-breaking, commits.

### Opening a pull request

1. Push your changes to your fork by running `git push origin your-branch-name`.
1. Open a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request), give it a clear title and explain what your changes do. Even provide a code snippet if you can!
1. Be prepared to update your PR based on feedback. If you make updates, run `git push origin your-branch-name -f` on your branch to update the PR on Github.

### Keeping unmerged forks up to date with master

If your fork is taking a while to get merged, you might end up getting behind Anchor's dev branch as other changes get added. Stay up to date in the following way:

1. `git fetch upstream 0.9-dev` This will give you all the latest updates from Anchor's dev branch.
1. Run `git rebase upstream/0.9-dev` while inside your feature branch. This will add all the new commits **before** yours, so it's as if you made the changes to the latest codebase.

### When coding, always use coding standards

If you're familiar with open source software, you probably know how important coding guidelines and standards are. Most common are (in order of appearance) PEAR, Zend(Framework) and [PSR-1](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1)/[PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2).

Since the [PHP-FIG](http://www.php-fig.org) and their standards gain more and more followers and Anchor uses composer, which supports PSR-0 and PSR-4, all code should follow [PSR-1](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1) and [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2).
More help on best practices for PHP development can be found on [PHP the right way](http://www.phptherightway.com).

When working on a file, always enforce coding standards for the whole file. This increases the consistency of the code with every contribution!
